# TODOs

 - [ ] Licence for h/w
 - [ ] Link to my QMK fork and branch
 - [ ] List of limitations with v1 (plate hole in wrong place, stab screw conflict with 60% case post, maybe unnecessary holes? in the plate for 60% cases I use) (also need to clip one of the legs on a switch going in the RHS enter position - this is on the RHS, row above bottom one)
 - [ ] Other improvements? E.g.: Expose Pico debug connector for debugging QMK with the Rasperry Pi debug peripheral?
