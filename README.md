# Oxwich50

The Oxwich50 keyboard is a 40-50% keyboard that can be mounted in a 60% traymount case, using the GH60 mounting points.

It was inspired by the many unibody split keyboards that I saw in the [Keyboard Builders Digest newsletter](https://kbd.news/). A lot of those keyboards had 30-36 keys, which seemed like too few for me. I wondered what a 60% keyboard would be like if you removed some keys, added an arrow cluster, and split the halves a bit, for a _potentially_ more comfortable typing position.

The PCB and plate were designed and made for me by [Mechboards Ltd](https://mechboards.co.uk/) in the UK.

Please see also my [keymap](https://github.com/richdawe/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/oxwich50/keymaps/richdawe/keymap.c) and the [QMK support](https://github.com/richdawe/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboards/oxwich50), both in my fork of the QMK firmware.

The keyboard is named after [Oxwich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxwich), which is a village on the Gower, near Swansea in Wales, UK.

# TODOs

 - [ ] Licence for h/w
 - [ ] Add photos
 - [ ] List of limitations with v1 (plate hole in wrong place, stab screw conflict with 60% case post, maybe unnecessary holes? in the plate for 60% cases I use) (also need to clip one of the legs on a switch going in the RHS enter position - this is on the RHS, row above bottom one)
 - [ ] Make the PCB compatible with o-ring mounting in a Bakeneko60 case
- [ ] Other improvements? E.g.: Expose Pico debug connector for debugging QMK with the Rasbperry Pi debug peripheral?
